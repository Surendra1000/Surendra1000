                <p class="text-cuper-small">As much as we’d all like one, there is no rulebook on how to get over a breakup. After a relationship ends, people 
                    (unsurprisingly) often report feeling loneliness, a loss of a sense of self, distress, and depression1. In fact, many experts 
                    have equated having a broken heart to a form of grief. In other words: If you’re struggling to move on from a breakup, you are far from alone.</p>
                <br><br>

                <p class="text-cuper-small">
                    “A breakup is a classic example of what we call an ambiguous loss, which is where the grief of the loss of a relationship is 
                    often complicated by a lack of closure,” Michaela Decker, a licensed 
                    marriage and family therapist in Mesa, Arizona, tells SELF. This, she says, can prolong the healing process and leave us feeling unresolved. 
                    And after a breakup, we are often mourning not just the loss of a romantic partner, but also the dreams and expectations we had for our futures. 
                    It’s a layered heartbreak that is tricky to navigate. And though there is no quick fix for how to get over someone, there are things you can do to 
                    help you through your own healing process. Here, experts and people who have been there before give their 20 best tips on how to deal with heartbreak.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <b>1. Think about your breakup as a physical injury.</b>
                    <br>Andrea Liner, Psy.D., suggests trying to give yourself the same grace when healing from having your heart broken that you 
                    would if you were experiencing a medical issue. “You may not be operating at 100%, and that’s okay,” Dr. Liner tells SELF, 
                    noting that you wouldn’t beat yourself up for not going to the gym after, say, breaking your leg. “Extend yourself the same 
                    kindness for going through an emotional injury,” she says.<br>

                    <br><br>

                    <b>2. Give yourself permission to feel your feelings.</b><br>
                    Susan Birne-Stone, Ph.D., a licensed clinical social worker in Brooklyn, suggests setting a timer and giving yourself 10-20 minutes 
                    to feel whatever you are feeling without judgment. Write out any thoughts about the breakup in a letter that you will never give 
                    your ex (or just speak your thoughts out loud). When that timer goes off, ask yourself: “What do I need now? Do I need to speak 
                    with someone that loves me? Do I need to do something physical? Do I need to take a shower, eat, self-pleasure, watch a movie? 
                    What will be nurturing in this very moment that will also feel good after?” You can repeat this as needed!<br>

                    <br><br>

                    <b>3. Reconnect with things that make you happy.</b><br>
                    Dr. Liner suggests dusting off old hobbies you may have stopped doing while busy in your relationship. “We naturally shift away from 
                    various activities while dating, and it can be empowering to get back to them,” she explains.<br>

                    <br><br>

                    <b>4. Surround yourself with good support—and lots of it. </b><br>
                    Naturally, your inclination may be to lean on your friends for support during and after a breakup. Try not to let embarrassment or 
                    anxiety hold you back from doing just that. “One of the things I hear most from clients going through breakups is that they’re 
                    worried about burdening or annoying their networks,” says Dr. Liner. “So it can be helpful to rotate who you’re talking to.” 
                    <br>
                    Depending on the specifics of your situation—like if the breakup was expected and if you’ve been keeping up with your friends a 
                    normal amount during your relationship—they may not be surprised to hear the news. Hopefully, they’ll spring into action and help 
                    you feel better in the specific ways that only people who really know you can.<br>

                    <br><br>

                    <b>5. And apologize to your support system if you need to.</b><br>
                    But if you’re itching to reach out to people you’ve lost touch with for some reason, whether it’s getting caught up in your 
                    relationship or the madness of the pandemic, you can reach back out—and own your mistake if you need to, Dr. Liner says. For 
                    instance, if you basically fell out of orbit because you were that in love, she............
