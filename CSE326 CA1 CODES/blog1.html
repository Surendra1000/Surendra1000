                <p class="text-cuper-small">A relationship breakup, breakup, or break-up is the termination of a relationship. 
                    The act is commonly termed "dumping [someone]" in slang when it is initiated by one partner. 
                    The term is less likely to be applied to a married couple, where a breakup is typically called a separation or divorce.<br><br>
                    Common causes for breakups include personality differences, lack of time spent together, infidelity, lack of positive interactions 
                    between the couple, low sexual satisfaction, and low overall relationship satisfaction. 
                    Ending a relationship is one of the most difficult things we have to do.</p>

                    She asked me to do a triathlon her brother was doing and she was going to watch his son. 
                    I have never done one before but she told me she really thought it would be good for me and would be proud of me if I did it. So I did.<br><br>

                    It was a whole weekend camping trip. It rained the whole time.... we got there on Friday, I unpacked set up, cooked, cleaned
                    and did everything the whole trip. Her brother apparently forgot to register so it was just me doing the triathlon then, which was
                    on Sunday. Woke up at 5 a.m., jumped in the coldest water I have ever been in to start but finished it (it was a mini triathlon so
                    like swim half a mile, 13 mile bike ride and a 5k run but still that’s a lot for me). 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-cuper-small">Anyway, it ended, I went back to camp. She made me pack everything up, then told me if I could put the tent in the original 
                    cardboard box it was in, not just the bag it was in. When I said she was welcome to do it herself, she told me her ex had no 
                    issue doing it (mind you I’m exhausted from, you know, the godd--n triathlon and she just watched me pack up everything 
                    alone). I put it in the box but ripped it halfway down. Didn’t give a s--t. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-cuper-small">Drove the 3 hours home and she broke up with me on the car ride home 
                    because “she just didn’t see any potential in me anymore.” So yea good times.</p>

                    After we broke up she called to tell me she was pregnant and needed $600 for an abortion.
                    I did the math and it was impossible I was the father. I told her I wanted to keep the baby and that 
                    I'd be happy to take it and she could even terminate her parental rights and not have to pay child support. I would be 
                    a single dad. A week later she "miscarried."<br><br>

                    My ex proposed to me publicly, at a bar, in front of all of our friends. He liked the way 
                    it went so well that he proposed to me two more times at two different bars (we were bar-hopping — LOL). In our 
                    hometown. In front of everyone we know. I said yes. Three times.<br><br>

                    So, we set a date and I plan this whole wedding. Buy the dress, set up the hall and the catering. 
                    Flowers. Everything. The only jobs he had were to buy/rent tuxedos for himself and his groomsmen and 
                    find someone to marry us on the date we had chosen.<br><br>

                    It was getting really close to our date and he hadn't done any of the things that he agreed to do. I 
                    finally confronted him about it, about a month before this whole event that.................................
