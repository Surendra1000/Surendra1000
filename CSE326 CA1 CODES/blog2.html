                <br>
                <p class="text-cuper-small">Every relationship has its ups and its downs. Sometimes, a relationship heads in the wrong direction, 
                    and you might desperately try to save it. You can try to stop an imminent breakup by 
                    getting ahead of the issue and trying to problem-solve with your partner. 
                    Then, take steps to improve the bond you have with one another. However, not all relationships are meant to last.
                    Determine your reasons for staying and see if leaving is actually the right move for you.</p>

                    <br>1.Request a little time-To prevent your breakup, get ahead of the problem. Pull your partner aside to talk. 
                    Let them know your suspicions about the impending breakup and ask for some time to mend things.<img src="Image/Request a little time.png">
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>2.Get some space-After you agree on a time-frame to work on your problems, take a few days for yourself. 
                    Spend some time thinking about the issues in your relationship and how you want to proceed.<img src="Image/Get some space.png">
                    <br>

                    <br>3.Hash out your grievances-Once you and your partner have had time to yourselves, meet back up to exercise your conflict resolution skills. 
                    Take a look at which parts of the relationship aren't working and work together to find solutions.<br><img src="Image/Hash out your grievances.png">
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>4.Use "I" statements-A lot of conflict can be resolved by simply changing the way you speak to your partner. 
                    Using "you" statements feels accusatory and forces them to defend themselves. When 
                    you use "I" statements, you can express your feelings without making your partner defensive.<img src="Image/Use I statements.png">

                <p class="text-cuper-small"><br><b>METHOD-2:Strengthening Your Bond</b>
                    <br>1.Remind each other why you fell in love-Compliments, gift-giving, or small gestures of love and appreciation can go 
                    a long way towards reviving your relationship. Focus on getting closer by paying 
                    attention to the little things that you did early on, but may have started to neglect as time passed.<br>
                    <img src="Image/Remind each other why you fell in love.png">
                    <br>
                
                    <br>2.Be open about your needs-Many problems arise because one partner or the other isn't getting 
                    their needs met in the relationship. Communication is key to 
                    a healthy relationship and the foundation of that involves each partner being able to tell the other what they need.<br>

                    <br>3.Practice active listening skills-Both individuals want to feel heard in a relationship, so make an effort to become better listeners. 
                    When you and your partner discuss serious issues relating to your relationship, act as if it's an important appointment 
                    (because it is!). Mute your phones, turn off the TV, and give one another your full attention.<br>
                    <img src="Image/Practice active listening skills.png">
                    <br>

                    <br>4.Make time for romance and affection-The spark in your relationship may wax and wane over time. But, it's your 
                    job to keep it burning by committing to intimate one-on-one time. This may translate..............
